Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Machine Learning Project
This project is an implementation of a machine learning solution for detecting and mitigating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The project aims to analyze network traffic patterns and leverage machine learning algorithms to identify and mitigate potential DDoS attacks in real-time.

Introduction
DDoS attacks are malicious attempts to disrupt the availability of a service by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic from multiple sources. This project aims to build a machine learning-based solution to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks in real-time. By analyzing network traffic patterns, the model can learn to distinguish between normal traffic and traffic associated with DDoS attacks.

Usage
To run the project, execute the following steps:

Start the data collection module to capture network traffic.
Preprocess the collected data to extract relevant features.
Train the machine learning models using the preprocessed data.
Evaluate the performance of the trained models.
Integrate the models into a real-time detection and mitigation system.

Evaluation
The performance of the machine learning models should be evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation should be performed on a separate test set to assess the generalization capability of the models.
